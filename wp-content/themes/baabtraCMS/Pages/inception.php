          <p class="wow fadeInUp">Started in 2011 by a number of young entrepreneurs from the field of software programming, BAABTRA believes that knowledge industry provides a unique opportunity to people with a skill set without worrying about their respective locations. This amazing possibility has not been fully actualised due to the lack of proper streamlining of regions. Companies find it either hard or expensive to reach out to the talent outside the metros. Freshers from other regions have to go through a lot before they are able to prove themselves before a company. BAABTRA, the regional talent's door to the software universe, facilitates this communication and helps the best get to the best!
